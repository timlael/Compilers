LOCAL OPTION SUBMISSION

Compilation:
To compile, simply run the "make" command from a terminal while in the project root directory 
containing all of the project source and header files as well as the Makefile. Compilation will
create the testSem executable.

"make clean" will remove the testSem executable.
"make realclean" will remove the testSem executable as well as any files with the .4280E01
extension.

Invocation:
testSem [filename]:

testSem 			- Invokes program and user is prompted for input.
					Keyboard simulated EOF terminates input.
testSem < filename 	- Invokes program and input is read via stdin file redirection.
					filename must be precise including extension (if any).
testSem filename 	- Invokes program and input is read directly from file.
					filename should not include implicit extension (.4280E01)

Project Detail:
Per the project specification for the local semantic checking option: 
	Variables have to be declared before their first use.

	A variable name can only be declared once within a scope.

	Variables declared outside of a block (after the program keyword and before the first start 
	keyword) are of global scope and are available to all functions within the program.

	Variables within a block have a scope of that block.

	C rules apply for variable declaration/use... smaller(local) scope hides larger(outer) scopes
	including global scope.

Project Testing:
	A bash script (p3test) has been included which runs the program with various inputs to test many 
	aspects of the project.
	In order to use this script, simply invoke "p3test" from a shell in project root directory. 
	You will be prompted for input along the way and results will be displayed on the terminal 
	with pauses after each test so that you can study the test results. Alternatively, you can 
	redirect the output to a file by invoking as p3test>outfile.txt. Redirection will still 
	require pause confirmations, but no test output will be displayed. Instead, test output will 
	be stored in the provided file name.
